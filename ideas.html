      <p id="about_para"><b>Society</b> is a virtual reality game which teaches social skills to autistic people in a familiar setting.
          Skills are learned through interaction with the game's characters in a virtual replica of the user's environment.</p><br>
      <p id="about_para"><b>Goals:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce and manage stress caused by having to learn skills in an unfamiliar environment.
          <li>Reduce and manage embarassment-induced stress caused by using incorrect skills during social interaction.
          <li>Improve conversation-prediction skills, reducing stress caused by unpredictable situations.
        </ul>

        <p id="about_para">Gameplay</p>
      </div>
      <p id="about_para">The game is structured as a role play in which the player levels up through interacting with non-playable characters (NPCs) who are programmed to respond to appropriate body language.
        The player completes quests and interacts with randomly generated NPCs, akin to fighting spawned monsters in typical massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs).<br><br>
        Appropriate body language is measured based on appropriate eye contact, calmness (possibly measured by heart rate), sentence structure, and voice modulation. Furthermore, any specific body language
        (e.g. shaking hands in some situations when meeting people) is measured by its exhibition in the correct situation. These situations will occur during quests.</p><br>
      <p id="about_para">As the player levels up, they will have the option to change their surroundings from their real-life surroundings to some preset environment, such as a walk in the park. The player
        also has the option to randomize random aspects of the preset environments, so as to more closely mimic real life.</p><br>
      <p id="about_para">When the player reaches the maximum level in the game, they will have the option to interact with other players following the same randomized constraints as above, but still
        preserving their ability to toggle randomization as they desire. When interacting with other players, they will level up their "real-world" player profile based on use of appropriate body language.</p>
